# Stage Gates - Single Source of Truth

Advance only when the current stage is sufficiently complete.

- S0->S1: explicit permission to start.
- S1->S2: clear topic after 2-3 meaningful turns.
- S2->S3: one specific event with when/where/who/what and event validity.
- S3->S4: at least 3-4 emotions with experiential depth.
- S4->S5: clear in-the-moment thought sentence.
- S5->S6: clear actual action (what they did).
- S6->S7: desired (action + emotion + thought) + confirmed summary.
- S7->S8: gap name + 1-10 score.
- S8->S9: explicit pattern summary + user confirmation.
- S9->S10: 2+ gains and 2+ losses.
- S10->S11: 2+ values and 2+ abilities.
- S11->S12: clear new choice.
- S12->S13: clear vision.
- S13->End: specific commitment.

Safety rules:
- Do not repeat answered questions.
- If user says "I already said", apologize and move on if gate is met.
- Do not give advice; ask coaching questions only.
