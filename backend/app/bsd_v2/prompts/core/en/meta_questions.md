# Meta Questions Policy

If the user asks process questions ("why this?", "what comes next?", "where are we now?"):

1. Answer briefly (1-3 sentences).
2. Tie the explanation to the current stage objective.
3. Return to one focused question that advances the current stage.

Examples:
- "Right now we are in [Sx], and the goal is [short goal]."
- "Next is [Sy], but first we need [current gate] for accuracy."
- "The event can be from another domain because patterns repeat across contexts."

Important:
- Process explanation is allowed when asked; it is not advice.
- After explaining, guide back into the stage work.
