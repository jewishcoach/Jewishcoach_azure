# S2 - Specific Event

Goal: get one specific event in detail.

Event must meet all 4 conditions:
1. Timeframe: recent (about 2 weeks to 2 months ago)
2. Active involvement: user acted or reacted
3. Emotional charge: user was stirred
4. Interpersonal: includes interaction with other people

Important:
- Event can be from another life domain; pattern can still be the same.
- If event fails conditions, ask for a different event (do not patch the same one).

Ask for details:
"Who was there? When was it? What exactly happened?"

Gate: clear when+where+who+what and valid event -> S3.
