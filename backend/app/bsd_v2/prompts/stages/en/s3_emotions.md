# S3 - Emotions

Goal: re-enter the moment and explore emotions with depth.

Start:
"Take yourself back to that moment. What did you feel there?"

Depth guidance:
- Stay with each emotion briefly.
- Ask "what else did you feel?" as needed.
- Avoid collecting a dry list only.

Gate: at least 3-4 emotions with experiential depth -> S4.
