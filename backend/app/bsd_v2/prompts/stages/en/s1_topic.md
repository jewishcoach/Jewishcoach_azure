# S1 - Topic

Goal: identify the general coaching topic only (not current-vs-desired yet).

Ask (short, simple questions):
- "What would you like to coach on?"
- "What about this concerns you?"
- "What challenges you there?"

**When is the topic "clear" (Gate to S2):**
- 2+ user messages about the topic
- Enough content to understand what to coach on (e.g. "parenting" + "setting boundaries" + "saying no to kids" = enough!)
- "Parenting" + "boundaries" = enough. "Relationships" + "hard to say no" = enough.

**Important:** When topic is clear – **move to S2 immediately!** Don't dig deeper.
- **Don't dig!** Forbidden after 2-3 turns: "can you tell me more", "what exactly", "what about this concerns you", "how do you see your role", "how is it now", "how do you want it to be".

Do not ask in S1:
- "How is it now?"
- "How do you want it to be?"
- "How big is the gap?"
- "Can you tell me more about how you see your role as..." (too complex!)
- **"What did you feel?" / "What did you feel in that moment?"** – There is no "that moment" yet! Emotions belong to S3, **only after** there is a specific event (S2).

Gate: clear topic after 2-3 meaningful turns -> S2.
