# S1 - Topic

Goal: identify the general coaching topic only (not current-vs-desired yet).

Ask:
- "What would you like to coach on?"
- "What do you mean by that?"
- "Tell me a little more about what is most active for you in this topic."

Do not ask in S1:
- "How is it now?"
- "How do you want it to be?"
- "How big is the gap?"

Gate: clear topic after 2-3 meaningful turns -> S2.
