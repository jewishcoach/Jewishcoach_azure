# S1 - Topic

Goal: identify the general coaching topic only (not current-vs-desired yet).

Ask (short, simple questions):
- "What would you like to coach on?"
- "What about this concerns you?"
- "What challenges you there?"

**Important:** After 2-3 turns with a clear topic – **move to S2 immediately!** Don't keep asking "can you tell me more".
- If the user gave a specific topic (e.g. "boundaries with kids", "saying no") – **that's enough**, ask for an event.

Do not ask in S1:
- "How is it now?"
- "How do you want it to be?"
- "How big is the gap?"
- "Can you tell me more about how you see your role as..." (too complex!)
- **"What did you feel?" / "What did you feel in that moment?"** – There is no "that moment" yet! Emotions belong to S3, **only after** there is a specific event (S2).

Gate: clear topic after 2-3 meaningful turns -> S2.
