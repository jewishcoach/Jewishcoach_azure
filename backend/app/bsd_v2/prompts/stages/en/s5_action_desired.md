# S5 - Actual Action + Desired

Order:
1. What did you actually do?
2. What would you want instead? (action, and if needed desired emotion/thought)

Summarize as pattern:
"In that moment, you felt [emotion], thought [thought], and did [action]. Is that accurate?"

Wait for confirmation.

Gate: actual + desired + confirmed summary -> S6.
